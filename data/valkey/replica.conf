# valkey-replica.conf - Configuration for a Valkey Replica Instance
#
# This file defines the settings for a Valkey instance that will
# act as a replica (slave) of another Valkey primary (master) server.

################################## GENERAL ###################################

# Specify the PID file path if running as a daemon. Each Valkey instance
# must have a unique PID file.
pidfile /var/run/valkey_6380.pid

# The port this Valkey replica instance will listen on.
# It MUST be different from the primary's port and any other Valkey instances
# on the same machine.
tls-port 6380

# Specify the log file for this replica. Each Valkey instance should
# have its own log file for easier debugging.
logfile "/var/log/valkey/valkey_6380.log"

# Number of databases available. Must match the primary's 'databases' setting.
databases 16

################################# REPLICATION ################################

# This is the MOST IMPORTANT directive for a replica.
# It tells this Valkey instance to become a replica of the specified primary.
# Format: replicaof <primary_ip> <primary_port>
replicaof 127.0.0.1 6379

# If your primary Valkey instance is password protected (using 'requirepass'),
# you must set this directive to the primary's password.
# masterauth your_primary_password_here

# By default, replicas are read-only. This is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to prevent
# accidental writes to the replica and to maintain data consistency.
# If you set this to 'no', clients can write to the replica, but those writes
# will be lost if the replica resynchronizes with the primary (e.g., after a restart).
replica-read-only yes

# If the primary is using TLS, enable TLS for the replication connection.
# This assumes you have TLS certificates configured correctly below.
# tls-replication no # Set to 'yes' if primary is TLS-enabled

# Minimum number of replicas that must be connected and in-sync for the primary
# to accept write operations.
# See 'min-replicas-to-write' and 'min-replicas-max-lag' on the PRIMARY.
# These settings are configured on the primary, not on the replica.

# Disconnect replica after N seconds if it's not receiving enough data.
# This helps detect stuck replicas. Default is 60 seconds.
repl-timeout 60

################################ SNAPSHOTTING (Persistence) ##################

# The filename of the RDB dump file for this replica.
# Make it unique, e.g., include the port number.
dbfilename dump-6380.rdb

# Save the dataset to disk. While the primary handles the authoritative data,
# having persistence on the replica is crucial for quick restarts and
# potential failovers (if using Sentinel).
# You can use the same save points as the primary, or adjust them.
save 900 1
save 300 10
save 60 10000

# Compress RDB files.
rdbcompression yes

# Verify RDB file integrity when loading.
rdbchecksum yes

# If AOF is enabled, specify its file name.
# appendonly no # Default, set to 'yes' to enable AOF on this replica
# appendfilename "appendonly-6380.aof" # Unique name for AOF file

################################## TLS (if enabled) ##########################
# Optional: Set to 0 to disable the non-TLS port
port 0

# Specify your TLS certificate, key, and CA certificate
tls-replication yes
tls-cert-file /root/valkey/tls/replica/valkey.crt
tls-key-file /root/valkey/tls/replica/valkey.key
tls-ca-cert-file /root/valkey/tls/ca.crt

daemonize yes
