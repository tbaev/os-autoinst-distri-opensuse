  SAP ASE smoke test for SLES for SAP.
  This will install SAP ASE in SUT, and then perform some small tests to confirm
  ASE is running after installation.
  It does not test for automatic startup after a boot, nor covers SAP ASE HA scenarios.
  Requires installation media and response file as openQA assets.
